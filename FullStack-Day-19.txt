==========

1) Local Variables in Functions
======================================
A local variable is a variable declared inside a function.
It is accessible only within that function and is destroyed once the function ends.

✔️ Example:
def show():
    x = 10   # local variable
    print("Inside:", x)

show()
print(x)   # ❌ Error: x is not defined

📌 Key Points:
Local variables exist only during the function call.
They cannot be accessed from outside the function.
They have the highest priority inside their function’s scope.


2) Nonlocal Variables in Functions
===========================================
nonlocal is used inside nested (inner) functions to modify a variable from the outer function’s scope (but not global scope).

✔️ Example:
def outer():
    x = 5
    def inner():
        nonlocal x   # refers to outer's x
        x += 5
    inner()
    print(x)

outer()   # Output: 10

📌 Key Points:
Used only inside nested functions.
Helps inner function modify outer function variables.
Cannot access global variables (use global for that).
